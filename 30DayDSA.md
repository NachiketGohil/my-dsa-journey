## 30-Day Learning Plan for Data Structures and Algorithms (Mobile App Focus)

#### Goal: Gain a solid foundation in essential data structures and algorithms for mobile app development and interview preparation.

This plan prioritizes practical knowledge and focuses on a manageable pace for a busy developer.

# Week 1 (Days 1-7): Arrays and Linked Lists

> Day 1-2: > Arrays 
- Understand basic operations (accessing, iterating, searching).
- Practice implementing basic array functionalities in Dart, Kotlin.

> Day 3-4: > Linked Lists
- Grasp the concept of nodes and pointers.
- Implement singly linked lists with basic operations (traversing, inserting, deleting).

> Day 5-6:
- Solve coding problems using arrays and linked lists.
- Examples: finding the maximum element in an array, reversing a linked list.

> Day 7:
- Review and quiz yourself on core concepts.
- Explore online resources for further clarification (GeeksForGeeks tutorials, LeetCode practice problems).


# Week 2 (Days 8-14): Stacks and Queues

> Day 8-9: Stacks
- Understand LIFO principle and applications (function calls, undo/redo).
- Implement a stack using arrays or linked lists.

> Day 10-11: Queues
- Grasp FIFO principle and applications (task scheduling, message passing).
- Implement a queue using arrays or linked lists.

> Day 12-13:
- Solve problems using stacks and queues.
- Examples: balancing parentheses, simulating a printer queue.

> Day 14:
- Review and quiz yourself.
- Explore online resources for stacks and queues (freeCodeCamp video tutorials, HackerRank practice problems).


# Week 3 (Days 15-21): Hash Tables and Basic Sorting

> Day 15-16: Hash Tables
- Understand the concept of hashing and key-value pairs.
- Implement a basic hash table using arrays.

> Day 17-18:
- Learn about collision resolution techniques.
- Solve problems using hash tables.
- Examples: finding duplicate elements in an array, implementing a simple spell checker.

> Day 19-20: Sorting Algorithms
- Understand the concept of time and space complexity.
- Learn basic sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort) for understanding purposes.

> Day 21:
- Review and quiz yourself.
- Explore online resources for Hash Tables (Abdul Bari video tutorial) and Sorting (visualizations on YouTube).


# Week 4 (Days 22-28): Binary Search Trees and Introduction to Recursion

> Day 22-23: Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
- Understand the concept, operations (insertion, deletion, searching).
- Implement a BST in your language.

> Day 24-25:
- Practice using BSTs for efficient searching.
- Solve problems like finding the lowest common ancestor in a BST.

> Day 26-27: Introduction to Recursion
- Grasp the concept of recursive functions and common use cases (backtracking problems).

> Day 28:
- Review and quiz yourself.
- Explore online resources for BSTs (GeeksForGeeks tutorial) and Recursion (interactive tutorials on websites).

> Day 29-30:
- Practice:
  - Dedicate these days to practicing on online coding platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.
  - Focus on mobile app development-related problems and gradually increase the difficulty level.
- Mocking Interview (Optional):
  - If possible, participate in a mock interview to test your knowledge under pressure and receive feedback.
