# Mobile app problem statement that involves Data Structures and Algorithms:

> Problem Statement:

## Develop a mobile app for a music streaming service that allows users to create and manage playlists efficiently. The app should address the following functionalities:


- Song Library: Users can browse through a large library of songs categorized by genre, artist, or album.
- Search: Users can search for specific songs using keywords (artist name, song title, etc.).
- Playlists: Users can create playlists with custom names, add/remove songs to playlists, and reorder songs within a playlist.
- Recommendations: The app recommends songs to users based on their listening history and playlists.

## Here's where Data Structures and Algorithms come into play:

- Song Library: A Hash Table can be used to store songs efficiently, allowing for fast retrieval by song title or artist name.
- Search: Binary Search can be implemented to efficiently search for songs within the hash table based on keywords.
- Playlists: An ArrayList or LinkedList can be used to represent each playlist, allowing for efficient addition, removal, and reordering of songs.
- Recommendations: A graph data structure can be used to model user-song relationships based on listening history. Then, a recommendation algorithm like collaborative filtering can be implemented to suggest songs similar to those a user has listened to in the past or liked by users with similar tastes (graph traversal algorithms).
